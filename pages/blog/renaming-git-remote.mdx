# How do I rename an existing Git Remote?

To change the name of an existing remote you’ll need to use the git remote rename command.

In order to change the name of your remote you will need two things.
1. The current name of your remote.
2. The name you want to change your remote to.

### Here's an example

Let’s say that your current remote name is “origin_1”. And now you want to change the remote name to  “origin_2”.

**1. Confirm the name of your current remote by running the following command:**

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
origin_1  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)
origin_1  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)
```

**2. Now that the current remote name is confirmed — you can change it by running the following command:**

```bash
git remote rename origin_1 origin_2
```

This command tells git to rename the current remote to something different. In this example, we’re changing the remote name to “origin_2”, but you can change your remote to be anything you want.

**3.  Verify that your remote has changed from “beanstalk” to “origin” by running the following command:**

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see an output like the following

```bash
origin_2  https://github.com/username/repository.git (fetch)
origin_2  https://github.com/username/repository.git (push)
```
