## ðŸ›  Suggesting Enhancement/Feature

We track Enhancements and Feature Requests as GitHub issues.

Before submitting an enhancement/feature request, **[perform a cursory search](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)** to see if the request exists. If it does, go through the conversation thread to see if there is additional information and contribute to the conversation instead of opening a new one.

If you find a **Closed** issue, go through the conversation thread to see if the feature has already been implemented or rejected. If not, you can open a new issue.

### How Do I Submit A Good Feature Request?

A good Feature Request should include the following:

- A clear and descriptive title of the request
- A detailed description of the request, including:
  - The problem you are trying to solve
  - How you are currently working around the lack of this feature
  - Any possible drawbacks of the feature
  - How the feature can be implemented
- An explanation of why this enhancement would be helpful to the project and the community
- Any links to resources or other projects that might help in implementing the feature

>*âœ¨ We suggest you to follow our **[Enhancement/Feature Request Template](/docs/templates/suggestion)** for submitting suggestions.*
