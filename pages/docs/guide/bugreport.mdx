## ðŸ’£ Bug Report

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating a new issue, **[perform a cursory search](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)** to see if the report exists. If it does, go through the discussion thread and leave a comment instead of opening a new one.

If you find a **Closed** issue that is the same as what you are experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original case in the body of your new one.

If you cannot find an open or closed issue addressing the problem, [open a new issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

Be sure to include a **clear title and description**, as much **relevant information** as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### How Do I Submit A Good Bug Report?

A good Bug Report should include the following:

- A clear and descriptive title for the bug report
- The exact steps to reproduce the bug
- The behavior you observed after following the steps
- The behavior you expected to see instead
- What might be causing the issue (if you have any idea)
- Screenshots or animated GIFs of the issue (if applicable)
- If you use the keyboard while following the steps, use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/byzanz) on Linux.

>*âœ¨ We suggest you to follow our **[Bug Report Template](/docs/templates/bugreporttemplate)** for reporting bugs.*
