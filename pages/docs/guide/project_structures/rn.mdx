   - This directory contains all the Android-specific files and configurations for your React Native project.
   - **app/src**: Where your Android application source code resides.
   - **build.gradle**: Build configuration file for the Android project.

3. **ios**: 
   - This directory contains all the iOS-specific files and configurations for your React Native project.
   - **MyReactNativeProject**: Directory containing iOS-specific source code files, such as `AppDelegate.h` and `AppDelegate.m`.
   - **MyReactNativeProject.xcodeproj**: Xcode project file.

4. **node_modules**: 
   - This directory contains the dependencies and libraries installed for your project using npm or yarn.

5. **src**: 
   - This is the main source code directory for your React Native project.
   - **assets**: Directory for storing static assets like images, fonts, etc.
