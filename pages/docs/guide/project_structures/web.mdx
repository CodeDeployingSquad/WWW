### Project Structure Explanation

1. **app**
    - **controllers**: This directory contains files responsible for handling the application logic. Each controller corresponds to a specific feature or set of related features.

    - **models**: The models directory is where you store data models. Models define the structure of your data and interact with the database.

    - **routes**: In the routes directory, you define the routes for your application. Each route may correspond to a different endpoint or feature in your application.

    - **views**: This directory holds your templates or views, especially if you are using a template engine like EJS. Views are responsible for rendering the HTML that is sent to the client.

6. **server.js**
    - This is the entry point for your application. It contains the main server setup and is responsible for starting your web server.

7. **README.md**
