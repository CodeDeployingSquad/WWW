## üìù Contributing Guide

If you want to do more than report an issue or suggest an enhancement, you can contribute to the project by:

- cloning the repository (repo)
- making your changes
- opening a pull request

### Cloning the Repository (repo)

#### 1. Fork the repo

Click the fork button at the top right of the page to create a copy of this repo in your account.

After successfully forking the repo, you will be directed to your repo copy.

#### 2. Clone the forked repo

On your forked repo, click the green button that says `Code`. It will open a dropdown menu. Copy the link in the input with the label `HTTPS` or `GitHub CLI` depending on your preferred cloning mode.

For HTTPS, open up your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone <your-clone-link>
# or
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<project-name>.git
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

You can also clone the repo using the GitHub CLI. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone <your-username>/<project-name>
```

#### 3. Set up the project

To set up the project, navigate into the project directory and open up the project in your preferred code editor.

```bash
cd <project-name>
code . # Opens up the project in VSCode
```

Install the dependencies (**Web/React-Native Projects**).

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Install the dependencies (**Flutter Projects**).

*Using **pub***
```bash
flutter pub get
```

Install the dependencies (**Python Projects**).

*Using **pip***
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Making your Changes

#### 1. Create a new branch

Create a new branch from the `main` branch. Your branch name should be descriptive of the changes you are making. E.g., `docs-updating-the-readme-file`. Some ideas to get you started:

- For Feature Updates: `feat-<brief 2-4 words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- For Bug Fixes: `fix-<brief 2-4 words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`
- For Documentation: `docs-<brief 2-4 words-Description>-<ISSUE_NO>`

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

#### 2. Run the project

- **Web Projects**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    # or
    pnpm start
    ```

- **React-Native projects**

    ```bash
    # For expo
    npx expo start
    # For iOS
    npx react-native run-ios
    # For Android
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

- **Flutter Projects**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

- **Python Projects**

    ```bash
    python your_script.py
    ```

#### 3. Make your changes

You are to make only one contribution per pull request. It makes it easier to review and merge. If you have multiple bug fixes or features, create separate pull requests for each.

#### 4. Commit your changes

Your commit message should give a concise idea of the issue you are solving. It should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, as this helps us generate the project changelog automatically. A traditional structure of commit looks like so:

```bash
<type>(optional scope): <description>
```

To commit your changes, run the following command:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

Eg:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add support for Next.js"
```

#### 5. Clean up your code and push changes

>Here is an example of a web project using pnpm as package manager

After committing your changes, run the following command before pushing your local commits to the remote repository and ensure that all tests pass and there are no linting errors.

```bash
pnpm cleanup
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

Once all tests and linting pass, push your local commits to your remote repository.

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Opening a Pull Request(PR)

#### 1. Create a new [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

Go to the **Project Repository** and click the `compare & pull request` button or go to the **Pull Request Page** and click on the `New pull request` button. It will take you to the `Open a pull request` page.

> Note: Make sure your PR points to the `main` branch, not any other one.

> ‚ú® We suggest you to follow **[Pull-Request Template](/docs/templates/prtemplate)** for creating a pull request.

#### 2. Wait for review

üéâ Congratulations! You've made your pull request! A maintainer will review and merge your code or request changes. If changes are requested, make them and push them to your branch. Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your branch and update.
